							Theme of the day (or week)
							[
							Simple lesson related to the client's area of concern along with experiential exercise and guided meditation
							]
							Area of specific concern
							[
							Each area has a series of questions for which
							there are four possible answers
							
							Example: (Client chose Intimate Relationship)
							Which stage would you say your relationship is in?
							
							1) Not in an intimate relationship at this time
							2) Romance (Just starting new relationship, excited, optimistic)
							3) Disappointment (Your expectations are not being met) 
							4) Power Struggle (conflicts turn into fights, attacking or withdrawing from each other)
							5) Hitting the wall (deadness, boredom, drifting apart)
							
							(Click here for tutorial, with more in-depth descriptions of each stage) [tutorials in animation]
							
							NOTE: For this example client chooses #4
							
							This power struggle began because of :
							1) Something my partner said
							2) Something my partner did
							3) Something my partner neglected to do
							4) Something my partner accused me of doing or not doing
							
							This question is just too help the client be clear for themselves. 
							Whatever number they pick will lead to next panel
							
							Which number best describes the typical behaviour of you and your partner when in a serious power struggle?
							
							Withdrawal from each other followed by long periods of silence
							1) A lot of arguing, using blame, and/or criticism of each other
							2) Partner verbally attacks me and I try to defend myself
							3) I verbally attack partner 
							4) I remain calm, but use passive aggression to attack partner
							5) Partner remains calm but uses passive aggression to attack me
							
							Next panel:
							On a scale of 1 to 10, how angry do you feel toward your partner.
							1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
							
							On a scale of 1 to 10, how angry does your partner feel toward you?
							1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
							
							The higher number determines which panel client goes to next. If client is more angry than partner, or as angry as partner, client goes to anger - pain - process panel
							If client’s partner is more angry, client goes to guilt -unworthiness -process panel
							
							Types of panels:
							anger - pain - process panel
							guilt -unworthiness -process panel
							
							5 minute tutorial on factors that perpetuate a power struggle
							(Need to be right, rejection of own discomfort
							Competition with partner, etc)
							
							If after client does process, they still maintain power struggle or anger at partner, they will be directed to above tutorial, and then will be directed to more panels on need to be right, rejection of own inner discomfort, etc)
							
							Discomforts chart will be introduced when client requires it

		Signing up process
		[
		Which Coaching Program have you chosen to follow?
		How do you imagine you will feel in order to determine that you have completed the program?
		Signing of release, acknowledging that this is a coaching program and its purpose
		
		Investment Options:
		
		2-Tier payment system
		$XX/year
		$XXXX - 1 time payment for 5 years (or lifetime)
		Note: Yearly payments may rise as our costs go up, and will be lowered as costs go down.
		The idea behind this 5 year plan is so as not to give the impression of the program as a money making scheme. Could consider making it a lifetime membership, but that’s risky.
